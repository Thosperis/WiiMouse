# WiiMouse
It uses the Wii Controller to move your mouse.
The DPAD Controls the mouse
The A button is left click
The B button is not set yet because i'm a fucking retard
The - button decreases the Dpad sensitivity
The + button increases the Dpad sensitivity
The Home button "holds" the mouse in postition so you can move the controller down and use the Dpad instead.
The 1 button increases the pointer sensitivity
The 2 button decreases the pointer sensitivity




If you want to build it yourself
